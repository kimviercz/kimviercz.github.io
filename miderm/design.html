    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    
<body>

<p>My website is designed to help keep students organized for their finals schedule. It takes user input and stores it as a cookie. I also included a "fun" page that allows the user to view quotes that rotate on a carosoul style as well as play with filling and emptying a glass of water.</p>



</body>
    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <body>
    <h3> I want to...</h3><p>a. Build and interface which can be used to create a schedule of what days you have finals.<br>
        b. Use storage in the form of cookies to save the information entered in the chart. <br>
        c. use JavaScript to create an image that will be changed based on what button the user clicks.</p>
        
    <h2>Design Concept</h2>

        <p>This diagram shows how the user is able to interact with each of the pages. It also shows what each screen offers in terms of JavaScript.</p>
        
        <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
        <p>1. I used the button tag to create a button and also to allow the website to change based on which button the user clicked. <br> 2. I also used the style tag to create intern as well as external CSS, similar to this I used the script tag to create internal and external JavaScript. <br> 3. I used the list tag to create ordered lists that allow my website to have a naviagtion bar that is in order. </p>
        
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>I used CSS to design the index page, I used external CSS for this page. This helped me create the top and side design for the page. I also incorperated internal CSS through the style of my fun page, this allowed me to design the two different elements seperately, but allow them to look good together.</p>
        
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        
        <p>I tried to incorperate JS into my website as much as possible because it was a new concept for me, so I wanted more practice. I have popups on my schedule page which is an example of JS, I also have the ability to add rows to the chart instead of having it a fixed size which is JS. In my fun page I used JS in the carasoul display of quotes as well as to change the image from a full glass to an empty glass and back. Even this page has JS in it, I used it to allow the user to hide or show the content of this page.</p>
        
        <h2>Extensions</h2>
        
        <p>I incoperated a lot of code and code snippets that were provided to us as examples, but I modified them to suit my needs. I also used some examples from W3Schools to help me with incorperating JS in the most effiecient and effective way. My CSS was from the example in class which I believe was from bootstrap. </p>
        
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        
        <h3>Alpha</h3>
        <p>1. The first issue I encountered was incorperating external CSS into my code, I was unable to do this based on my own creation, so due to time contraints I decided to use what was given to me as my CSS<br> 2. A second issue I encountered was not being able to add rows to my table. I fixed this through looking at what the code was doing and why the table was preset to a certain size then creating a button that allowed the user to determine when they wanted a longer table and from there I created a JS file that allowed the table to be extended. <br> 3. A third issue I faced was designing a page that looked well together even though it had two very different elements, I tried to incorperate a picture element into my fun page, but it's dementions messed with the format too much and did not add to the website, so to resolve this issue I got rid of it.</p>
        
        <h3>Beta</h3>
        <p>I asked my mom to review my website. Since she has very limited knowledge of how websites work, I showed her from my computer so I was there to walk her through how to use my website.<br>1. She reccomended creating a background image from my homepage to make it really pop, instead of just being black and white, so I added a background image to this page.<br>2. She recommended creating breaks between these paragraphs so they were easier to read, as well as centering them, which I also did.<br> 3. She also recommended taking off some distracting elements from the fun page, which I did. It is more simple now which makes it easier to follow.</p>
