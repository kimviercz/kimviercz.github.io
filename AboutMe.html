	  I have a pretty small family, I have<br>one older sister as well as my two parents.<br> We have also hosted several exchange students<br> while I was in high school.<br> Below is a picture of my and my "brother,"<br> Simone, who was one of our exhange students from Italy.<br>

        <h2 id="School">School</h2>
      I attended a very small high school,<br> so I decided to also attend a pretty small college.<br> As you probably could guess,<br> I go to Regis University<br> and my major is Computer Science<br> with a minor in Pyschology!<br> I am currently a Junior<br> and will graduate in 2018.<br>
