      <P>I have visited Mexico three times, and each time I have seen a different part of the country. Below are the major areas of Mexico that I have been to.
          <h1> Mexico! </h1>
          
          <ol>
	<li> <a href ="#PuertaVallarta">Puerta Vallarta</a></li>
	<li> <a href ="#Cancun">Cancun</a></li>
    <li> <a href ="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a></li>
    <li> <A HREF ="Index.html">Index</A></li>
	</ol>
          <h2 id="PuertaVallarta"> Puerta Vallarta</h2>
          
          This was my very first stop in Mexico, I visited here when I was 6 years old. My family and I returned when I was 14 and we even got to go zip lining!
          
          <h2 id="Cancun">Cancun</h2>
          
          This was my most recent trip to Mexico. I was there for a wedding. Below is a picture of one of the ancient Mayan ruins right along the coast. 
          <img src="images/IMG_1009.jpg" alt="Mexico" title="This is the ancient ruins on the coast" width="450" height="350" />
          
          <h3 id="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</h3>
          
          This city is my favorite in Mexico. There was lots of dancing at night and sights to see during the day. If I could go back and for some reason did not want to be on the beach I would go back to Zacatecas.
